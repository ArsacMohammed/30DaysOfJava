Now that you have the requirements for your Library Management System, you can proceed with the following steps:

Identify the Key Entities: Based on the requirements, identify the key entities in your system. These might include Book, Borrower, Transaction, and Author.

Design the Class Structure: Create the necessary classes to represent the entities identified in the previous step. Define the attributes and methods for each class. For example, the Book class might have attributes like title, author, ISBN, quantity, etc., and methods for adding, updating, and removing books.

Implement the Operations: Begin implementing the operations specified in the requirements. This includes functionalities such as adding books, adding borrowers, checking out and returning books, searching for books, generating reports, etc. Implement the necessary methods in your classes to handle these operations.

Handle Data Storage: Decide how you want to store the data for your library management system. You can use an in-memory data structure (e.g., ArrayList, HashMap) or implement a database using a lightweight database library (e.g., SQLite, H2). Create the necessary classes to handle data storage and retrieval.

Implement User Interface: Design and implement a user interface to interact with your library management system. This can be a console-based interface using text prompts and menus or a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Swing or JavaFX. The user interface should provide options for performing various operations, such as adding books, checking out books, generating reports, etc.

Test Your System: Write test cases to ensure that your library management system functions correctly. Test each operation thoroughly and handle edge cases such as duplicate books, invalid inputs, and unavailable books. Verify that the system produces the expected results.

Document Your Code: Document your code by adding comments, providing explanations for complex logic, and documenting class/method signatures. This will make your code easier to understand and maintain for yourself and others who may review your project.

Refactor and Improve: Continuously improve your code by refactoring it for better readability, maintainability, and efficiency. Look for areas where you can optimize your code or improve its structure.

Remember to take an incremental and iterative approach. Start with the basic functionalities and gradually build upon them. It's also helpful to use version control tools like Git to track your project's progress and maintain a clean codebase.

If you have any specific questions or need guidance at any step, feel free to ask. Good luck with your Library Management System project!
