/*DAO stands for "Data Access Object." It's a design pattern commonly used in software development to separate the data access code from the rest of the application's business logic. The primary goal of the DAO pattern is to provide an abstraction layer that shields the application from the underlying data storage mechanisms (such as databases) and allows for a more organized and modular code structure.

In the context of a Java application that interacts with a database, a DAO typically includes methods for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database, abstracting away the details of database connectivity, SQL queries, and data manipulation. This separation of concerns makes the application more maintainable, testable, and flexible.

Here's a brief overview of how the DAO pattern works:

1. **Data Access Object (DAO):**
   - Contains methods for interacting with the underlying data storage (e.g., a database).
   - Hides the implementation details of database interactions.
   - Provides a high-level interface for performing data-related operations.

2. **Domain Objects:**
   - These are the objects that represent the entities in your application (e.g., Book, User, Borrower).
   - Domain objects are typically used as parameters and return values for DAO methods.

3. **Database Connection:**
   - Handles the connection to the database.
   - Often a singleton class or managed by a connection pool.

4. **Benefits of DAO Pattern:**
   - Separation of concerns: Business logic is separate from data access code.
   - Code organization: Keeps database-related code isolated and easier to manage.
   - Reusability: DAO methods can be reused across different parts of the application.
   - Testability: Easier to write unit tests for business logic without involving the database.
   - Flexibility: Allows you to change the underlying data storage without affecting the rest of the application.

In your context, the `DatabaseConnection` class can be part of your DAO package (`dao`), as it deals with establishing and managing the database connection, which is a common responsibility of a DAO. You can further organize your code by creating DAO classes for each of your domain objects (e.g., `BookDAO`, `UserDAO`, `BorrowerDAO`), which will contain methods to perform database operations related to those entities.*/
